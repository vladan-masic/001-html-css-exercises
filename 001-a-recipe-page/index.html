    <h1>Homemade Yogurt (Classic & Creamy)</h1>
    <p>
      Here’s a simple, reliable homemade yogurt recipe you can make with basic
      ingredients, plus tips so it turns out thick and tasty every time.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 liter (4 cups) milk</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Whole milk = creamier yogurt</li>
        <li>Low-fat works too, just slightly thinner</li>
      </ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt (with live active cultures)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Store-bought is fine, as long as it’s unsweetened</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour the milk into a pot and heat it slowly over medium heat. Bring it
        to 85–90°C (185–195°F). Stir occasionally so it doesn’t scorch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pot from heat and let the milk cool to 43–46°C (110–115°F).
      </li>
      <li>
        Put 2 tablespoons of yogurt in a small bowl. Add a little warm milk and
        mix until smooth. Pour this mixture back into the pot and stir gently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the milk into a jar or bowl. Cover loosely (lid or cloth). Wrap it
        in a towel and place it somewhere warm. Let it sit for 6–10 hours. 6
        hours = mild and soft. 8–10 hours = tangier and thicker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Move it to the fridge. Chill for at least 3 hours. This stops
        fermentation and firms it up.
      </li>
    </ol>
